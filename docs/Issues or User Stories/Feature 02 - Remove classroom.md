As a user,
I need to be able to remove classrooms by name,
So that I can stop managing a classroom or remove a classroom that was added by mistake.

Acceptance Criteria:
* When the main menu displays, there is a menu item/option to remove a classroom.
* When the remove classroom option is selected, the user is asked for the name of a classroom to remove.
* Once the user enters a name, the classroom with the given name is removed from the classrooms managed by the program.
* After the classroom is removed, the main menu re-displays.

Notes:
* Some information may not be fully specified and is left up to the developer's discretion. In a real-world scenario, you would want to confirm these details with the client (probably through your scrum master or product owner). Examples include:
    * What is the exact wording of the remove classroom menu option?
    * What order does this menu item appear in, in relation to any other menu items?
    * What happens if no classrooms have been added?
    * What happens if the user enters a name that doesn't exist (hasn't been added as a classroom)?
