As a user,
I need to be able to list all students in a classroom, with a detailed summary of each student,
So that I can see where each student stands at a glance.

Acceptance Criteria:
* When the Classroom Details menu displays, there is a menu item/option to show students.
* When this menu item is selected, all the students in the current classroom are printed out.
* For each student, the information displayed is the same as that shown by the Show Summary option in the Student Details menu.
* After the students are printed, the user has a chance to read the list (e.g., by pausing until the user presses a key), and then the Classroom Details menu is re-displayed.
