As a user,
I need to show all assignments for a student,
So that I can see all assignments at a glance.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The Student Details menu has an option/item to show assignments (or list assignments, or similar).
* When this menu option is chosen, all assignments for the current student are printed.
* The user has a chance to see the information (e.g., by pausing until the user presses a key), and then the Student Details menu is re-displayed.
* The printout for each assignment includes:
    * Assignment name
    * An indicator (e.g. true/false, yes/no) of whether the assignment has been completed
    * The grade for the assignment.

Notes:
* Reminder: An assignment is complete when it is graded.
* Some information has been left unspecified and is up to the developer's interpretation. In a real environment, you would want to confirm these details with the client:
  * What is the wording of the menu option?
  * What is the format and wording for the printout? Is all the information for an assignment on one line or multiple lines?
  * Are there blank lines between assignments?
  * What grade displays if the assignment is not complete?
