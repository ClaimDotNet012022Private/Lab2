As a user,
I need to be able to see classrooms before certain operations,
So I can decide which classroom I want to select.

Acceptance Criteria:
* On the main menu, when certain menu items/options are selected, display a list of classrooms before doing anything else (importantly, before asking the user to input an classroom name).
* The classroom listing is displayed the same way as when the "Show Classrooms" menu item is chosen.
* When the user is asked to input an classroom name, the classroom listing remains visible on the console.
* The menu items that show the list of classrooms include:
    * Show Classrooms (of course, should already be implemented)
    * (All others are optional)

Notes:
* Your implementation may show the classroom listing for any menu items that you choose on the main menu.
