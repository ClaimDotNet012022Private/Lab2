As a user,
I need to be able to compare two students by name,
So that I can see which student has a higher average grade.

Acceptance Criteria:
* On the Classroom Details menu, there is a menu item/option to compare students.
* When this menu option is selected, the user is asked to input the names of two students.
* After the user enters the names, the students are compared, and a message is displayed indicating the name of the student with the higher grade (something like "Tracy has the higher grade" or "Jerry is the better student").
* After the message displays, the user has an opportunity to see it (e.g., by pausing until the user presses a key), and then the Classroom Details menu displays again.

Notes:
* Information that is left unspecified is open to developer interpretation. In a real world scenario, you would want to confirm these details with the client (probably through your scrum master or product owner). Some of these details include:
    * What happens if the students have the same grade?
    * What happens if one or both of the students don't have any assignments?
